     1	The bustle in a house
     2	The morning after death
     3	In solemnest of industries
     4	Enacted upon earth,-

     5	The sweeping up the heart,
     6	And putting love away
     7	We shall not want to use again
     8	Until eternity.
     9	Don't worry, spider,
    10	I keep the house
    11	casually.
